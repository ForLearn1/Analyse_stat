# Statistical_analysis

This program was created to perform statistical testers on a sample of around 1Million individuals (numerical values). We used a centered, reduced Gaussian law in order to ensure good security when we want to construct the LWE or the RLWE in the context of post-quantum cryptography or fully homomorphic encryption systems. This program allowed us to save a lot of time on statistical analysis linked to a real random variable, for example whether there is a bias or not. LWE: Learning with error RLWE: Ring learning with error
